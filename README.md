# Paper-Implementations

Implementation attempts of various AI papers in simple form etc. These implementations are not meant to be exact and are categorized into a general section.

This repository is primarily for my learning purposes. If there are any bugs, mistakes please don't hesitate to point out.

**WARNING: Codes may be incomplete, will likely have bugs, mistakes or plain wrong due to lack of proper understanding. Use at own risk.**

:rocket: Represents I am fairly confident implementation works on custom dataset and at least part of it is close enough to proposed paper topic. Also mostly tried to follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [google python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
